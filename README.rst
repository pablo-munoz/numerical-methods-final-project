Usage
-----

This ipython notebook is viewable in the browser which also provides an
interactive setting. The notebook assumes ``python3`` is available with
the libraries ``jupyter`` (for the displaying of the notebook),
``numpy`` for simplifying vetor and matrix operations and ``matplotlib``
for reading and displaying images. It is suggested that you create a
virtual environment for this project so that you do not pollute your
system-wide installation of python with these dependencies. To use the
virtual enviornment you do need to have the python ``virtualenv``
package installed system-wide, a typical usage would look like these:

::

    pip install virtualenv # ensure virtualenv is installed
    cd <dir-with-this-file>
    virtualenv venv # Create virtual envrionment "venv" (this will create a directory with a new python install)
    source ./venv/bin/activate # Activate the virtualenv
    pip install -r requirements.txt # Install all the dependencies, listed in requirements.txt file
    jupyter notebook # Open a browser tab with this notebook in interactive mode

To return to being able to use the system-wide installation of python
run the command ``deactivate`` from your terminal.

Note that you only have to setup the virtualenvironment onece, if you
wish to return to the notebook later you only have to start with the
command ``source ./venv/bin/activate # Activate the virtualenv``
